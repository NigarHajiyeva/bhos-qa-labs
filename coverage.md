# Line/Branch Coverage
The Line Coverage of a program is the number of executed lines divided by the total number of lines. Only lines that contain executable statements are considered, not those with pure declarations.
Branch coverage is a useful indicator for determining whether or not an application has been fully tested. A poor branch coverage indicates that there are possibilities in the application that haven't been properly tested. When the application reaches production, such scenarios may contain faults that will only show up in rare circumstances.
